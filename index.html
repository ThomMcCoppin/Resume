		<h1>Thomas McCoppin</h1>
		<p>
			My name is Thomas McCoppin and I'm a Junior B.I.T. major here at Midland.
			I'm apart of the esports team and also in the honors program. 
			I thoroughly enjoy hobbies such as watching anime, playing games, and some tabletops such as D&D.
			One of my major achievements includes the Award for Extraordinary Determination that I earned from competing in National History Day.
			Another achievement I'm proud of is hitting the Masters rank in Overwatch, where only the top 3% of players ever get too.
			A project I'm currently working is coding a game in C# using the Unity Engine, while I'm still working on exactly what to make, it's been a big undertaking.
